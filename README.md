# TALESWAPPER

This is a web app for story creators---and solo roleplayers specifically---to interact with readers in a new way. The flow looks something like this:

1. A creator plays their RPG (solo or otherwise), and takes notes from the session.
2. Later, the creator writes the story, using the notes to guide it. They include asides that reference dice rolls and other mechanics, possibly updating character attributes and traits, allowing the reader to follow along not just with the story, but with the game.
3. Readers may comment on each chapter of the story, suggesting ways the story might unfold next.
4. The creator can play and record multiple possible branches of the story, perhaps even branches that readers suggested, turning the story into a kind of interactive choose-your-own-adventure tale. Or, the story may be told in a single branch, linearly. It's entirely up to you!

Readers may subscribe to creators that they like, or to specific stories that they're following, to receive notifications when those creators post new stories, or when the stories have new content.

Ultimately, Taleswapper is about building a community of those who love to tell tales, and those who love to read those tales.
