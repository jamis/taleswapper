# TALESWAPPER

This is a web app for story creators to interact with readers in a new way. Creators tell part of their story, then invite readers to propose a "what happens next". Creators can let their story branch, "choose-your-own-adventure"-style, by accepting and narrating multiple possible outcomes.

## TODO

I would like to figure out how to deal with an evolving resource, though, like a character sheet, or the Mythic emulator lists.
