# INFINITIES

This is a web app for story creators to interact with readers in a new way. Creators tell part of their story, then invite readers to propose a "what happens next". Creators can let their story branch, "choose-your-own-adventure"-style, by accepting and narrating multiple possible outcomes.

## TODO

[ ] What other section types would be appropriate? "Aside"? I use asides a lot, personally, when "thinking out loud." It really comes down to how the different sections get formatted, I guess. And how should we present a "session zero" section?

Actually, no. "session zero" isn't a section type; it's a *chapter* type! Chapters can be different types, then. There's mechanical chapters, like session zero, and there's narrative chapters.

Maybe these aren't even different *types*. Maybe a story has an optional "session zero" chapter. Readers can start at the first narrative chapter, or they can read the session zero chapter first. It also gives them a place to refer back to later.

I would like to figure out how to deal with an evolving resource, though, like a character sheet, or the Mythic emulator lists.

And I think the section types need to be less prescriptive, too. Instead of "Fiction" vs "Mechanic", which implies a "right way" to use the section, it might be more like "Primary" and "Secondary". Ultimately, giving some control over how to format these might be nice, too? Or maybe the markdown is sufficient for text format?
