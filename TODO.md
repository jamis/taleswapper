TODO:

* Footnotes? Like, as a link, which pops open a little dialog with additional
  info. Could be a way to communicate non-tracker story info (like the thought processes behind the creation of Wulan's warband...?)
* When selecting an image, allow to choose between a new file, and any of the images that already exist in any chapter of the user's stories.
* Need a way to get to the user profile page on mobile (currently hidden on small screens)
* Reset password feature
* Could there be some way to "bulk publish" multiple chapters simultaneously?
  - hmm. Like a "chapter management" interface? Could be a way to also reorder
    chapters, insert a new chapter between two others, and delete chapters...
* Admin interface for manually adjusting data:
  - converting a user to a creator
  - editing any field of any table
  - moderating comments

* Editor
  - support sans-serif and monotype font selection
  - markdown-style shortcuts for certain things? (e.g. --- for mdash, etc)
* Autosave for chapters#edit
* Improve the "update card" display, using a diff algorithm to show what text has been added/removed. (perhaps https://github.com/deadusr/html-diff-ts)
* Allow a reader to view the track sheet at top of chapter and after each update.
* In chapter/edit, see the current state of the track sheet at each tracker update.
* "new sequel" view might offer an optional full-screen view, perhaps with notes and trackers as side-bars, always open?
* Creators need to be able to moderate comments on their own content.
  - creators could specify how they want moderation done: no moderation, or require moderation (no comments shown that aren't approved).
* Actually persist autosaves to the database, as well as to local storage.
* Some way to group a set of chapters.
* Option for a story or chapter to be downloaded (as PDF?) to be read offline. (Creator-level option)
  - How would this work for non-linear stories? (choose-your-own-adventure style?)
* Better front page. Perhaps cards for each creator? What will the page look like with hundreds of creators? Oh, we could show the top 10 (or whatever) creators with most-recently-updated stories!
* Could use a "chapter management" view.
  - reorder chapters
  - insert new chapters
  - delete chapters
* Wiki-style links with independent, linkable pages. These pages might stand independent of a single story, allowing multiple stories to share these wiki pages.
  - trackers on these wiki pages are problematic, though...unless you tie the tracker to a particular chapter of a story?
