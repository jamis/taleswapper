TODO:

* Seems like something might be wonky with the track sheet updates when editing a chapter. They seem to "leak" from one section to a previous section. Perhaps something with adding and removing sections (thus creating blank sections that don't actually get added)?
* Figure out how to make the app more resilient in the face of typos in the track sheet updates. (It hurts to lose your work because you typed an attribute name wrong, or forgot a brace.)
* Autosave for chapters#edit
* Subscriptions (allow readers to subscribe to creators, and to specific stories)
* Notifications
    - when comments are posted
    - when someone subscribes to you or one of your stories
    - when a new chapter is published
    - when a new story is published
* Resizable dialog boxes? Or maybe just make them generally larger?
* Media (images, audio, video?). Maybe treat it like the tracker updates, with each section having optional media that are displayed below the section? Or a dedicated section type?
* Allow a reader to view the track sheet at top of chapter and after each update.
* As with track-sheet updates, maybe have a way to display dice rolls prettily? Could be done via specialized markup, maybe? (Custom HTML tags?) Could custom HTML tags work for the track sheet updates, too? <dice>d6+1</dice> <dice>d10=4,d10=7</dice>?
* Consolidate consecutive sections of the same type, for display?
* Return to current page after logging in
