TODO:

1. Implement "track sheet" link on chapter edit.
2. Move the "add before/add after" links on sections to the bottom of the section, rather than the top.
3. Figure out how to make the app more resilient in the face of typos in the track sheet updates. (It hurts to lose your work because you typed an attribute name wrong, or forgot a brace.)
