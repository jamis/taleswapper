    The main character will be named *Wulan*. I picture him as a big, hulking thing, all muscle. He's gruff and distant to most people, intimidating and off-putting. He's not unintelligent, but his effort and time have gone into martial prowess, not intellectual skill.

    His stats will be:

    I think his warband is called "Wulan's Blade."

    His three starting bonds:

    * His sister, Nia. She is married to a fisherman in a village on the Ragged Coast. Wulan visits as often as he is able, and though he has always been reserved, he is a favorite with his nieces and nephews.
    * (let's leave the other two for now, and fill them in as we discover his history)

    We'll discover his background vow later, as well (but hopefully soon).

    Let's choose our truths at random:

    ## The Old World

    "The sickness moved like a horrible wave across the Old World..." Wulan's ancestors came to the Ironlands to escape a plague that devastated the old kingdoms.

    ## Iron

    "Inscrutable metal pillars are found throughout the land." Folk call them "iron fingers", though they never tarnish or rust. Some, like the Iron Priests, "worship them and swear vows upon them." Most do not trust them.

    ## Legacies

    "Other humans sailed here from the Old World untold years ago, but all that is left of them is a savage, feral people we call the broken."

    ## Communities

    "We are few in number in this accursed land. Most rarely have contact with anyone outside our own small steading or village, and strangers are viewed with deep suspicion."

    ## Leaders

    "Numerous clan-chiefs rule over petty domains. Most are intent on becoming the one true king. Their squabbles will be our undoing."

    ## Defense

    "Supplies are too precious, and the lands too sparsely populated, to support organized fighting forces. When a community threatened, the people stand together to protect their own."

    ## Mysticism

    "Magic is rare and dangerous, but those few who wield the power are truly gifted."

    ## Religion

    "A few Ironlanders still make signs or mumble prayers out of habit or tradition, but most believe the gods long ago abandoned us."

    ## Firstborn

    "The Firstborn hold sway in the Ironlands. The elves of the deep forests and the giants of the hills tolerate us and even trade with us."

    ## Beasts

    "Beasts of all sorts roam the Ironlands. They dwell primarily in the reaches, but range into settled lands to hunt."

    ## Horrors

    "We are wary of dark forests and deep waterways, for monsters lurk in those places. In the depths of the long-night...only fools venture beyond their homes."

    I dine with my warband this night. They are raucous and coarse, as ever, and usually I am ready enough to join in their revelries, but tonight...

    I dine with my warband this night, but my mind is on the Ragged Coast, miles and miles away.

    Wups. I need a name for Wulan's lieutenant. Rolling on the oracle, I get 9, "Artiga." What's he like? Oracle again! Role is "refute a falsehood." Descriptor is 90 = "fervent."

    Might as well roll up a couple others for the warband, too. Kuron, who is apparently "infamous," and Valeri, who is "wary."

    "Wulan!" shouts Artiga, my lieutenant. He is a fiercely intense man, most times, but in moments such as these he manages to become one of the most bacchanalian of revelers. "Wulan!" he shouts again, as he staggers, drunken, to my side. "Come! Join us! Kuron promises to sing the Lay of Sidan again."

    I am tempted, not because Kuron sings particularly well, but because the *last* time he sang that lay, we laughed until we had no breath left in us. The man has a voice like a rock toad in the best of times, and when he's drunk his talent declines yet farther.

    "I'll be there soon," I say, knowing that I'm probably lying, but there's no graceful way to decline a drunk man's invitation. It suffices to put Artiga off, though, and I watch as he staggers back to the fire with the others.

    My mind turns again to the Ragged Coast, and to Nia, my sister who lives there with her family. I have had troubling word from her just this afternoon. She cannot write---which makes no difference since I cannot read---but a troubadour found me today, and he had been in her village. He could not stay, alas, or our entertainment would be far better than Kuron's rendering of "the Lay of Sidan," but he said that my sister had been asking for news of me, for many months, and had bid all minstrels that found me to bid me find her in return.

    This is a difficult request. My men are comfortable here, in the Hinterlands. We've made a reputation for ourselves among the villages hereabouts, and the people are quick to share their provisions with us in exchange for a bit of security from those that have tried to prey upon them.

    It is a puzzle. I haven't seen Nia in years---not since the birth of her first child---but we were inseparable as children, and I swore that I would always be there for her.

    Hmmm! I don't think this is the background vow, though. It's too general. It's not even a good fit for the "inciting incident" vow. I actually don't think this is anything to do with an actual "iron vow." It's just a thing he told her when they were children.

    Which, of course, does not diminish at all what it means to Wulan.

    I could go by myself, leaving my men in Artiga's care, but that doesn't sit right with me. The people here call them "Wulan's Blade" for a reason, and though they might follow Artiga for a time, they need *me*.

    And, frankly, I need them.

    So, do I command them to follow me to the Ragged Coast? They would come, and they would even come willingly. But Ironlanders are a suspicious lot, by and large, and a band of armed men would not sit comfortably with most settlements. A dozen men eat a lot, and unless they are kept busy, they also cause a lot of mischief. Villages would not welcome such company willingly.

    Not for the first time, my mind turns to the reason for Nia's call. The minstrel knew nothing of her purpose. In fact, he said she seemed well enough when he was there just a month ago. Her need must not be urgent, then, but still...

    She asks for *me*. My sister needs *me*.

    I rise in the morning, having slept little, and stomp feeling back into my legs and feet. The air is chilly, but holds the promise of a warm day in its snap.

    "Artiga!" I call as I walk through the camp. My men grump and look at me blearily, obviously the worse for drink. Artiga sits up abruptly and groans, holding a hand to his head.

    "Wulan?" he mumbles. "Is something wrong?"

    I go to his bedroll and drop to one knee. "I've made a decision," I say, "and I want you to witness my oath."

    Artiga licks his lips and squints at me. "Your oath? For what?"

    "I'm taking us to the Ragged Coast," I say, "to answer my sister's call. I would swear an oath that I will do whatever is in my power to aid her."

    "The Ragged Coast, though?" Artiga looks horrified. "What about the people here?"

    I nod. I've thought long about this. "I will stay here for two more weeks, organizing the people so that they can defend themelves. They will survive."

    Artiga hesitates, but nods. "You're serious?"

    "Very."

    "I will witness your oath, then."

    "Come."

    Given the truths I rolled at the beginning, "iron" refers not to the metal, necessarily. Especially with regard to oath-swearing, "iron" refers to the mystical pillars. I think they are ubiquitous enough that they are no more than an hour away.

    I tell the men that Artiga and I will be back later. There are some grumbles that I take for acknowledgment, and then we're off.

    There is an Irondale an hour's walk from us, and we make for it. I tell Artiga about how I arrived at my decision, and ask for his council. He is not a particularly wise man, but he knows me well. He understands why I must do this thing.

    "But Wulan," he says. "You've also sworn to protect the people of these lands. You have a responsibility to that oath, as well."

    Ah! There's the background oath. Wulan has sworn to protect the people of this area. We'll get more details as we go, but I suspect there's some force that has been threatening them, perhaps one of the Firstborn tribes?

    I think this also is one of his beginning bonds, with the people of the Hinterlands (or, at least, those in the area immediately around him).

    "I will keep that oath," I say. "We will return, Artiga, and I will see to the people here in the Hinterlands. I've realized, though, that part of that oath is teaching them to defend themselves."

    When we finally reach the Irondale, the sun is warm upon us and we are both glad to finally sit and rest a moment. Below us, in the dale, are four black metal spikes, each one as tall as several men. The largest is wide enough at its base that I cannot reach my arms around it. The smallest is as thick as my thigh.

    Though we call this an "Irondale," the spikes are not truly iron. No man can dent them. No smith can work them. Though they are metal, they are hardy and impenetrable. We swear our oaths on them, that our determination may be as durable as these.

    We make our way down the hill and stand among the spikes. Artiga nods and urges me to begin.

    I place one hand on the spike and look to the sky, where the spike seems to point, and I speak the words...

    Okay, first roll of the game. Wulan will *Swear an Iron Vow*. Though his sister isn't present, this is for her, and he does share a bond with her, so he gets +1. The roll, +heart, +1: 6+2+1 = 9 vs 2, 6. That's a strong hit!

    With portentious weight, the oath settles into me. I nod, satisfied, knowing that I've chosen the right path for me, right now.

    Somehow, I must keep the villagers safe in my absence. The Vledshka have harassed them for years, now, pouring from the forests at night, burning a hut or two, killing sheep and goats, and retreating again---typical varou skirmish tactics. Until a few years ago they were nothing but scattered, bickering tribes, too busy fighting amongst themselves to pose any serious threat to the surrounding human villages.

    Then, Staysa came.

    Staysa is a massive, charismatic, and ambitious varou who has managed---against all odds---to unite the tribes beneath his banner. I really don't know much more than that---varou are not especially willing to talk with humans in the best of times---but it is largely due to Staysa's ambition that I and my men are kept so busy.

    The name he picked for his clan, "Vledshka," translates to something like "Roots of the Elder Tree," and the human villages apparently threaten the purity of those roots. The varou want us out, and they harass and skirmish with us regularly.

    I need to make sure the villagers can handle this in my absence, because the last thing I want is to return in a few months to burned homesteads and scattered corpses.

    I council with the men of the villages, and with my own men as well. The villagers are alarmed when I tell them that I am leaving, and fill the council room with a babble of panicked voices, but I expected this.

    I think Wulan is going to take the fight to the Vledshka, next, to bloody them and make them more wary. He is going to gather a handful of men from each of the villages, forming an army of three or four dozen total, including the men of Wulan's Blade. Fighting the Varou in the forest itself seems unwise, though. I think he's going to try and be wily here.

    "I have a plan," I tell them, speaking loudly to get their attention. The din subsides and I look them each in the eye. "The Vledshka have preyed on us long enough. It is time for us to take the fight to them."

    They look shocked, and I try not to smile.

    "We hit them hard," I say. "We seize the initiative and hit them hard, hard enough that they'll think twice before they return to harassing our villages. We show them that we have teeth, and claws, just as they do. And we show them that we know how to use them at least as well. Here's what we'll do..."

    Yeah, he's going to try and Secure an Advantage, +shadow, which isn't great for him. He'll note where the Vledshka have attacked in the past, and hide up most of the men nearby. Then, he'll lead a small party---just a handful of men---straight up the middle of a valley, attempting to lure the Vledshka out of their woods and into the open.

    The forest looms before us, dark and unwelcoming, stretching like a wall to the northwest and southeast and laying across the rolling hills like a blanket. Long ropes of wet moss hang in limp cords from branches, and drape the trunks of some trees so thickly that I can hardly make out the bark beneath them. The underbrush is thick and seemingly impassible, but I know better.

    We all know better, now.

    The Vledshka can move through that terrain as easily as we move across open ground, flowing like ghosts through even the densest brush and thicket. It would be suicide to go in there---the varou would have us surrounded in seconds, and we'd be cut down before we had time to pull our swords clear of the foliage.

    No. We need to take the battle to the Vledshka, but not like that.

    I look to my right, where Artiga walks with head down and shoulders hunched. He feels the claws of the varou upon him already, I know, but he will fight when the fighting comes. A braver man I have never known.

    To my left walk the twins, Keearus and Kormak, both tall and broad shouldered with beards of such striking red that more than the once the varou have left them alone out of pure superstition. They step lightly, grinning like simpletons.

    "Stop that," I say to them. I speak softly, for the varou have excellent hearing and I cannot afford to have any wolf-folk ears overhearing. "We need to look a tempting target, not a brazenly confident one."

    Keearus---who bears a livid white scar across his left cheek---immediately looks contrite. "Sorry, Wulan," he mutters. He and his brother adopt expressions that are probably supposed to look frightened and nervous. It will have to do.

    The Vledshka take the bait. It's not their entire clan, of course---Wulan could never stand against that---but it's perhaps an entire tribe's worth of warriors. The Vledshka pour from the forest, descending on Wulan and his handful of men...

    I begin to question the wisdom of my plan, as we walk for nearly a quarter of an hour, farther and farther from where the others are hidden. If we go much farther we'll truly be isolated, and easy meat for the Vledshka. I grow uneasy. Finally, I turn to Artiga, the words "turn around" on my very lips---

    A howl erupts from the woods. First one, then another, and another. It is a sound we've grown to hate--if not to fear--over the last year of fighting the Vledshka.

    "Finally," I hear one of the twins say, followed by the sounds of steel sliding free of scabbards.

    "Fools," I say. "Not here. We're too far from our men." I look up as what must be an entire tribe's worth of varou warriors bursts from the forest and swarms down the hill toward us. "Run! Now, run!"

    Do not think me a coward. I do not run out of fear. If it had truly been merely the four of us, I would have fought---and died, most likely---but fought, nevertheless. No, I do not run out of fear, and my men understand this. We run for *joy*, for our trap has worked!

    The Vledshka run at our very heels, snarling and cursing in their gutteral, lapine tongue. Keearus and Kormak make barking noises at them, egging them on, and laughing all the while. Artiga simply runs. He, like me, is focused on the coming battle.

    Ahead, I can see our chosen battleground. A few small copses of trees, and some scattered boulders as large as houses. The rest of my men, and some two dozen villagers besides, are hidden there, waiting for my cue. I have no doubt that they can hear the ululations of the Vledshka. I know I can count on my men to maintain their discipline, and remain in hiding until my signal. The villagers, though...

    We are a hundred yards away, now. I pray for the villagers to hold themselves still. If they emerge from hiding too soon, the Vledshka will realize the trap and run for the forest. *Hold*, I pray. *Hold.*

    Fifty yards. Thirty.  Twenty...

    "To arms!" I yell and I turn to face the horde behind me. My sword comes free of its scabbard in a single practiced motion. "Up, and to arms!"

    I'll run this as a "Battle" move. The objective is to force the varou back into the woods, sending them reeling and yelping away so that they will be unlikely to return to battle any time soon. Wulan is using his band, here, so gets a +4 to the roll: 5 + 4 = 9 again, vs. 2, 10. For crying out loud, what's up with the tens??? Okay, so, weak hit. "You obtain your objective, but not without cost. *Pay the Price.*"

    I just have time to take a breath before the first of the varou is upon me. He is enormous, with massive teeth and a huge scythe-like sword that he swings at me with a howl. I dodge aside and answer with my own strike, drawing the sword across his belly and spinning to meet the next attacker.

    Screams and howls mingle, the cries of the dying and the grunts of the living, the smell of blood sharp on the air, and heat rising up and surrounding everything in its merciless grasp. The ringing sound of metal on metal punctuates the battle like a heartbeat, and I dance to its martial rhythm.

    Time seems to slow, and then stop. This desperate moment stretches on, and on, and on. The ground beneath me turns slowly muddy with the blood of the dying, and the footing becomes treacherous. I dance on, dodging and swinging, retreating and advancing. I gasp for each breath.

    Then, suddenly, the enemy is stumbling away from me, shouting and yelping, running up the hill and back to the forest. A few of my men make to chase after them.

    "Stop!" I cry. "Let them run. The day is ours!" I lift my blood sword above my head, surprised to find my strength barely sufficient to do so. I feel utterly exhausted.

    There is a ragged cheer from the others, who also lift their weapons high. The day is ours. We've won.

    But as I turn to face the band of men who fought so bravely beside me, I have to wonder: *at what cost?*

    The field is littered with a dozen or more fallen varou and men, some groaning in pain, others dead and still. I see two red-headed men struggling to get to their feet, and rush to them.

    "Keearus!" I cry. "Kormak!" The brothers look up at me, and I see that Kormak will have a new scar on his face to match his brother's. For a moment, I feel a surge of relief that they are not more badly hurt, but then I see blood running freely from Keearus' side, and from Kormak's leg, and I step quickly to help them.

    "Here," I say. "Lay back down. Your wounds must be tended immediately."

    "We'll be fine--" Kormak tries to say, but shudders in pain and falls to his knees.

    "I can see that," I say dryly, and then turn to find others of the Blade. "The twins need help!" I cry. "Bring bandages!"

    The village men are likewise seeking out their wounded, and calling for healing. Others are lifting a few of the still bodies, preparing to carry the dead back to their villages for burial. My heart aches for them, and for the families left without brother, father, husband, but all knew the risks going into this. All knew that some would not return.

    We do what we can in the field to stabilize the wounded, and gather the dead, and then return to the nearest village. We leave the varou dead and wounded where they lay, trusting that the Vledshka will know best how to care for them.

    The villagers welcome my band, and we join them in remembering their dead. The fallen men fought bravely, and we sing a dirge in their honor as we burn their bodies on the traditional pyre. The smoke carries their spirits away to paradise.

    I remain with the villagers for the better part of a week, planning our trek and gathering provisions. The twins regain their strength quickly, and though I try to leave them behind---to heal, and to organize the defense of the Hinterlanders---they seem determined to spite my efforts by healing quickly. By the time we are ready to leave, they are on their feet and walking again.

    I smile wryly, simultaneously glad to have them, and frustrated at their refusal to rest. Well, it is what it is.

    We leave in the morning.
